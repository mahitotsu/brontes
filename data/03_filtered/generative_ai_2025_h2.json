      "description": "Starting today, the compute-optimized Amazon EC2 C8a instances are\n                available in the Europe (Spain) region. C8a instances are powered by 5th Gen AMD\n                EPYC processors (formerly code named Turin) with a maximum frequency of\n                4.5 GHz, delivering up to 30% higher performance and up to 19% better\n                price-performance compared to C7a instances.  C8a instances\n                deliver 33% more memory bandwidth compared to C7a instances, making these instances\n                ideal\n                for latency sensitive workloads. Compared to Amazon EC2 C7a instances, they are up\n                to 57% faster for GroovyJVM allowing better response times for Java-based\n                applications. C8a instances offer 12 sizes including 2 bare metal sizes. This range\n                of instance sizes allows customers to precisely match their workload\n                requirements.  C8a instances are built on AWS Nitro\n                System and are ideal\n                for high performance, compute-intensive workloads such as batch processing,\n                distributed analytics, high performance computing (HPC), ad serving, highly-scalable\n                multiplayer gaming, and video encoding.  To get started,\n                sign in to the AWS Management Console. Customers can purchase these instances via\n                Savings Plans, On-Demand instances, and Spot instances.

      "title": "AWS IoT Core adds message batching to HTTP rule action",
      "description": "AWS IoT Core now lets you batch multiple IoT messages\n                into a single HTTP rule action, before routing the messages to\n                downstream HTTP endpoints. This enhancement helps you to reduce cost and\n                throughput overhead when ingesting telemetry from your Internet of Things (IoT)\n                workloads.  AWS IoT Core is a fully managed service that\n                securely connects millions of IoT devices to the AWS cloud. Using rules for AWS IoT, you can filter, process, and decode\n                device data, and route that data to AWS services or third-party endpoints via\n                20+ AWS IoT rule actions, such as HTTP rule action - which\n                routes the data to HTTP endpoints. With the new feature, you\n                can now batch messages together before routing that data set to downstream HTTP\n                endpoints.  To efficiently process IoT messages using the new\n                batching capability, connect your IoT devices to AWS IoT Core and define a\n                HTTP rule action with your desired batch parameters. AWS IoT Core will then process\n                incoming messages according to these specifications and route the messages to your\n                designated HTTP endpoints. For example, you can now combine IoT messages\n                published from multiple smart home devices in a single batch and route it to a HTTP\n                endpoint in your smart home platform.  This new feature is\n                available in all AWS Regions where AWS IoT Core is available, including AWS\n                GovCloud (US) and Amazon China Regions. To learn more, visit our developer guide, pricing\n                page, and API\n                documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon WorkSpaces now supports IPv6 for WorkSpaces\n                domains and external endpoints,\n                enabling users to connect through an IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack configuration from\n                compatible clients (excluding SAML authentication). This helps customers meet IPv6\n                compliance requirements and eliminates the need for costly networking equipment\n                to handle address translation between IPv4 and IPv6.  Dual-stack\n                support for WorkSpaces addresses the Internet's growing demand for IP addresses by\n                offering a vastly larger address space than IPv4. This eliminates the\n                need to manage overlapping address ranges within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).\n                Customers can deploy WorkSpaces through dual-stack that supports both IPv4 and IPv6\n                protocols while maintaining backward compatibility with existing IPv4\n                systems. Customers can also connect to their WorkSpaces through PrivateLink VPC\n                endpoints over IPv6, enabling them to access the service privately without routing\n                traffic over the public internet.  Connecting to Amazon\n                WorkSpaces over IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack configuration is supported in all AWS Regions\n                where Amazon WorkSpaces is available, including the AWS GovCloud (US East &\n                US West) Regions. There is no additional cost for this feature.\n                 To enable IPv6, you must use the latest WorkSpaces client\n                application for Windows, macOS, Linux, PCoIP zero clients, or web access.\n                To learn more about IPv6 support\n                on Amazon WorkSpaces, refer to the Amazon\n                WorkSpaces administration guide.",

The\n                granularity allows you to maintain comprehensive visibility into your IoT\n                operations without the overhead of logging every activity at the same verbosity\n                level, improving log searchability and analysis efficiency while helping to reducing\n                costs. Event-level logging is now available for configuration\n                through the AWS IoT console, CLI, and API in all AWS Regions where AWS IoT is\n                supported.

With OCSP support, customers\n                in these Regions can implement more efficient certificate validation with minimal\n                bandwidth, typically requiring a few hundred bytes per query, versus downloading\n                large Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) that can be hundreds of kilobytes\n                or larger.

Amazon SageMaker Studio is a fully\n                integrated, browser-based environment for end-to-end machine learning development.\n                SageMaker Studio provides pre-built container images for popular ML frameworks like\n                TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn that enable quick environment\n                setup. However, when data scientists need to tailor environments for specific use\n                cases with additional libraries, dependencies, or configurations, they can build and\n                register custom container images with pre-configured components to ensure\n                consistency across projects. As ML workloads become increasingly complex, these\n                custom container images have grown in size, leading to startup times of several\n                minutes that create a bottlenecks in iterative ML development where quick\n                experimentation and rapid prototyping are essential.  SOCI indexing\n                addresses this challenge by enabling lazy loading of container images, downloading\n                only the necessary components to start applications with additional files loaded\n                on-demand as needed. Instead of waiting several minutes for complete custom image\n                downloads, users can begin productive work in seconds while the environment\n                completes initialization in the background. To use SOCI indexing, create a SOCI\n                index for your custom container image using tools like Finch CLI, nerdctl, or Docker\n                with SOCI CLI, push the indexed image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry\n                (ECR), and reference the image index URI when creating SageMaker Image\n                resources.  SOCI indexing is available in all AWS Regions where\n                Amazon SageMaker Studio is available.

Research and Engineering Studio on AWS\n                is an open source solution that provides a web-based portal for administrators to\n                create and manage secure cloud-based research and engineering environments.\n                RES enables scientists and engineers to access powerful Windows and Linux virtual\n                desktops with pre-installed applications and shared resources, without requiring\n                cloud expertise.  Tags applied to the CloudFormation\n                stack now propagate to all resources created during RES deployment, making it easier\n                to track costs and manage resources across your organization. Administrators can\n                disable automatic Windows domain joining for hosts, providing flexibility\n                to implement custom domain-join logic when needed. You can now set a default\n                schedule for all new desktop sessions, helping teams standardize session management\n                practices. This version includes several security improvements to help RES\n                deployments meet the NIST 800-223 standard and fixes a bug where some sessions were\n                logged out after 2 minutes when using a custom DNS domain.  This\n                release is available in all AWS\n                Regions where RES is available.

      "description": "Today, Amazon GameLift Streams launched two new capabilities to\n                optimize performance and cost: Gen6 stream classes and enhanced autoscaling with\n                warm buffer. The new Gen6 stream classes provide a wider range of price\n                performance options, while autoscaling enables customers to dynamically manage\n                capacity scaling.   The seven new Gen6 stream classes\n                available today are based on EC2 G6 instances powered by NVIDIA L4\n                Tensor Core GPUs, which provide up to 2x higher performance over Gen4 stream\n                classes.\n                The pro and ultra stream\n                class deliver improved performance for\n                graphics-intensive AAA games, while\n                the medium and small stream\n                class offer cost-efficient options for casual games. The\n                gen6n_small stream class is available\n                at $0.16/hour in us-east-2.   The enhanced autoscaling\n                capabilities provide automatic capacity management that scales\n                provisioned capacity dynamically with demand, helping customers optimize utilization\n                and stream start time for new players. Developers can use the new capacity controls\n                (minimum, maximum, and target-idle capacity) to precisely manage their\n                scaling needs.   New Gen6 stream classes are available\n                in five AWS Regions: US West (Oregon), US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), Europe\n                (Frankfurt), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo). Improved autoscaling is\n                available in all AWS Regions where Amazon GameLift Streams is offered.

      "description": "Today, Amazon GameLift Streams launched new powerful observability\n                capabilities with session performance stats that provide real-time data for\n                individual stream sessions, offering insights into application performance\n                issues. Game developers requested deeper visibility into session\n                performance and resource utilization. The new stats we're delivering today help\n                developers understand how their applications perform on specific stream\n                classes and GPUs, giving them the data to make optimal GPU selections, optimize\n                performance, and troubleshoot individual user experiences. Developers can now access\n                detailed data on CPU, memory, GPU, and VRAM usage for active sessions\n                through the GameLift Streams Web SDK, or view them in the AWS console's built-in\n                overlay on the \"Test stream\" page. These performance stats can also be exported to a\n                file for post-session analysis. GameLift Streams also\n                launched improved session status reasons and error messaging. Game developers now\n                have deeper insights and actionable information on the reasons for stream session\n                termination, enabling them to root cause unexpected termination and improve\n                their troubleshooting experience.   The stream session\n                performance stats and improved API error messaging are available in all AWS Regions\n                where Amazon GameLift Streams is offered at no additional\n                cost.

This new capability captures detailed per-request\n                telemetry for end-to-end tracing, debugging, and compliance monitoring.\n                 Amazon ECS Service Connect makes it simple to build secure,\n                resilient service-to-service communication across clusters, VPCs, and AWS accounts.\n                It integrates service discovery and service mesh capabilities by automatically\n                injecting AWS-managed Envoy proxies as sidecars that handle traffic routing,\n                load balancing, and inter-service connectivity. Envoy Access logs capture detailed\n                traffic metadata enabling request-level visibility into service communication\n                patterns.

Amazon MSK is fully compatible with Apache Kafka, which\n                enables you to more quickly migrate your existing Apache Kafka workloads to Amazon\n                MSK with confidence or build new ones from scratch. With Amazon MSK, you spend\n                more time building innovative streaming applications and less time managing Kafka\n                clusters.  Amazon MSK offers two types of Apache Kafka\n                provisioned broker - Standard brokers and Express brokers. Standard brokers offer\n                the most flexibility to configure your cluster’s performance. You can configure\n                availability, durability, throughput, and latency. You also control the storage\n                configurations on your cluster and are responsible for managing storage\n                provisioning and utilization. Express brokers are a new broker type for Amazon MSK\n                Provisioned designed to deliver up to 3x more throughput per broker, scale up to 20x\n                faster, up to 5x more partitions per broker, and reduce recovery time by\n                90% as compared to Standard brokers.

      "title": "AWS launches simplified import of CloudTrail Lake data in Amazon CloudWatch",
      "description": "Today, AWS launches simplified import of CloudTrail Lake data in\n                Amazon CloudWatch, a data management and analytics service that allows you to unify\n                operational, security, and compliance data across your AWS environment\n                and third-party sources. With this launch, you can now import your historical\n                CloudTrail Lake data into CloudWatch with a few steps enabling you to easily\n                consolidate operational, security, and compliance data in one place. In CloudWatch,\n                you simply specify the CloudTrail Lake event data store (EDS), and the date range to\n                initiate import of your CloudTrail data. Simplified import of CloudTrail Lake data\n                is supported via the AWS console, CLI, and SDK. \n                While simplified import of CloudTrail Lake data is available at no additional cost,\n                you incur CloudWatch fees based on custom logs pricing. To learn more about\n                simplified import of CloudTrail Lake data and supported AWS regions, visit the\n                Amazon CloudWatch documentation.",

      "description": "Starting today, AWS WAF is available in the AWS Asia Pacific (New\n                Zealand) Region.  AWS WAF is a web application firewall that\n                helps you protect your web application resources against common web\n                exploits and bots that can affect availability, compromise security, or consume\n                excessive resources. With AWS WAF, you can control access to your content. Based on\n                conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests\n                originate from or the values of query strings, your protected resource responds to\n                requests either with the requested content, with an HTTP 403 status code\n                (Forbidden), or with a custom response.  To see the full list of\n                regions where AWS WAF is currently available, visit the AWS Region Table. For more information about the\n                service, visit the AWS WAF page.
